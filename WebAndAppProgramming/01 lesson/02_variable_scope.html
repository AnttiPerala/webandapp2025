        const myEmergencyNumber = 112; //each country has a different emergency number so we might not want to have it global like this

        //document.body.innerHTML = myGlobalVariable + mySecondGlobalVariable; //we can reference the global variable from anywhere in the code. Here we are adding two things to the page at the same time due to a question from students.

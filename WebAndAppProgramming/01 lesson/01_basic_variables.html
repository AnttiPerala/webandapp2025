       This would throw an error:

        //being able to mutate the properties of the objects inside consts makes more sense when you think about selecting html elements: if you could not change any property of an element selected inside a const, that would kind of suck. But you can mutate the properties of an element inside of a const, you just cant reassign the entire const.

        //if using consts feels difficult, you can always use a let instead. A let will not give you any trouble with reasignments.

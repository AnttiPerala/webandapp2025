        //What are data structures?
        //Data structures are a way of storing, retrieving and managing collections of data

        //Most common data structures in JS are arrays and objects, and then there are sets and maps
        //Less common data structures are typed arrays, weakMap and weakSet

        //Arrays
        //Arrays are ordered collections of values

        let myArray = []; //empty array

        let fruits = ['Apple','Banana', 'Pear']; //an array with some values, by the way tomato is also a fruit

        fruits.push('Tomato'); //add a value to the end of the array

        //we regret the tomato and dont want it in our fruit salad
        
        fruits.pop(); //remove the last value from the array

        //we want to add a value to the beginning of the array

        fruits.unshift('Orange'); //add a value to the beginning of the array

        //Filter the array based on the string lenghts

        let longFruits = fruits.filter(myfruit => myfruit.length > 5); //filter the array based on the string lengths

        //iterate over the array using a forEach loop

        fruits.forEach((thefruit) => { //for each fruit in the array, call the individual fruit thefruit and do the following
            document.body.innerHTML += thefruit + '<br>'; //write the fruit names to the page and add a line break after each one
        })
